## What is it?

**VAULT HUNTER** is a fast, grid-based web game. Scan tiles to trace a hidden contamination source before the mission clock runs out. Read the heat numbers, dodge radiation pockets, grab intel, and make each location blissfully boring again.

**Features**
- 10√ó10 tactical grid with Manhattan-distance ‚Äúheat‚Äù hints (0‚Äì6)
- Multiple locations with unique lore & intel drops
- Mission timer, energy management, and Geiger feedback
- Keyboard & touch friendly, mobile-first layout
- No frameworks‚Äîjust HTML/CSS/JS

## How to play

- **Click / tap** a tile to scan.
- Numbers (0‚Äì6) = heat toward the source (higher = closer).
- **‚âà** Radiation (hurts energy), **‚ú∂** Intel (pauses timer), **‚ò¢** Source.
- **Space / Enter** scans the focused tile.  
- **MUTE** toggles audio. **MENU** returns to the main menu.

**Option A ‚Äî Python**
```bash
# From repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit:
http://localhost:8000/vaulthunter/
