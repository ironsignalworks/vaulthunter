Vault Hunter '84 - Characters

🧪 1. Irina “Red Mercury” Volkova
Specialty: Radiation Forensics & Vault Extraction

Once a top Soviet physicist, Irina now uses her brilliance to sniff out nuclear anomalies like a bloodhound. She sees through fake signatures and decodes isotopic trails.
Quote: “Radiation never lies. People do.”

💀 2. Vladimir “Glowstick” Sokolov
Specialty: High-Risk Recon & Disinformation Detection

Glows faintly in the dark after a 'mishap' in Pripyat. Perfect for lighting up dark vaults—and lighting up enemy lies. He’s your man when deception clouds the mission.
Quote: “If it flickers green, it’s probably fine.”

🐀 3. Klaus “Rat Bastard” Meier (literally a rat)
Specialty: Tunnel Infiltration & Wiretapping

A genetically modified East German lab rat with a taste for espionage. Can squeeze into tight ducts, disable tripwires, and eavesdrop on enemy signals.
Quote: “Squeak squeak, comrade.” (Translated from Morse.)

🧊 4. Konstantin “Core Meltdown” Dragunov
Specialty: Heavy Entry & Tactical Sabotage

A one-man demolition crew with nerves of steel and an energy bar that drains real fast. He blasts open vaults and shuts down irradiated zones—if he doesn’t melt first.
Quote: “Tick... tick... tick... boom.”

🕯️ 5. Valerika “Gamma Candle” Petrescu
Specialty: Signal Decryption & Occult Intel

Romanian exile and shortwave psychic. Tunes into strange Cold War frequencies, including the dead ones. She’s your best hope for decrypting Vatican-level weirdness.
Quote: “I heard it whisper through the static... it wants out.”
